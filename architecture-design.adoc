= High-Load Order Processing Architecture (E-Commerce)
:author: Vibe Software Developer
:toc:

== Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a high-load, real-time order processing system in an e-commerce environment. The flow includes:

. Creating a new order
. Making a payment via a third-party system
. Notifying the user at each step via SignalR

== Technology Stack

* Azure SQL Server
* Azure Service Bus
* Azure Service Bus Emulator
* AppInsights
* ASP.NET 8
* MassTransit
* Docker
* SignalR

== Services

=== Order Service

*Project:* `OrdersApi`

*Responsibilities:*

* Validate user and payment input
* Persist order in Azure SQL
* Emit `OrderCreated` event

*Technologies:*

* ASP.NET 8
* Entity Framework Core
* MassTransit + Azure Service Bus

*Best Practices:*
* Use transactional outbox pattern
* Ensure idempotent processing using correlation IDs

*Patterns:*

* Domain-Driven Design
* Transactional Outbox
* Event-Driven Architecture

=== Payment Service

*Responsibilities:*

* Subscribe to `OrderCreated`
* Call third-party payment gateway
* Emit `PaymentProcessed` event

*Technologies:*

* ASP.NET Worker
* MassTransit + Azure Service Bus
* Polly for retries and circuit breakers

*Best Practices:*

* Use gateway pattern for external calls
* Correlate AppInsights logs across services

*Patterns:*

* Saga/Process Manager
* Circuit Breaker
* Retry with Exponential Backoff

=== Notification Service

*Responsibilities:*

* Subscribe to all key events
* Use SignalR to notify client in real-time

*Technologies:*

* ASP.NET SignalR
* MassTransit + Azure Service Bus

*Best Practices:*

* SignalR groups by user/session
* Fallback to polling if needed

*Patterns:*

* Pub/Sub
* Real-Time Push Notification

=== Order Controller (API Gateway)

*Responsibilities:*

* Accept initial user request
* Initiate order flow
* Manage SignalR session

*Technologies:*

* ASP.NET 8
* SignalR JavaScript client
* Dockerized for horizontal scaling

*Best Practices:*

* Use correlation ID for observability
* Design stateless controller for resilience

== Key Architectural Considerations

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Concern            | Strategy
| Scalability        | Docker + Azure Load Balancer + Horizontal scaling
| Fault Tolerance    | Circuit breaker, retry, fallback (Polly)
| Observability      | AppInsights tracing with correlation ID
| Data Consistency   | Eventual consistency via outbox pattern
| Real-Time Feedback | SignalR with group/user mapping
| Backpressure       | Azure Service Bus + TTL + Dead Letter Queues
|===

== Event Flow Summary

. Client initiates order
. Order Service persists and emits `OrderCreated`
. Payment Service processes payment and emits `PaymentProcessed`
. Notification Service updates UI via SignalR
. Final `OrderCompleted` event triggers UI update and logs

== Design Patterns

* Saga Pattern
* Circuit Breaker
* Event-Driven Architecture
* Transactional Outbox
* Idempotent Receiver
* Real-Time Notification via SignalR
